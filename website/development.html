			<p>Take a look at the <a href="features.html">features</a> we would like to add in the future!</p>

			<p>Hands Free Chrome is intended as an open source project, and the source will be released on GitHub within a few weeks.</p>

			<p>My time will soon be taken over by other worthwhile projects, and I'm going to want to hand this off to more capable developers who can take what I've started and run with it.</p>

			<p>Truth be told, I think this functionality should just be built into the Chrome browser itself, no extensions involved. That would make it the most handicapped-friendly application in existence, and almost certainly nobody could build the system better than the Chrome engineers themselves.</p>

			<p>In the meantime, there is much work to be done, particularly with internationalization, and while I'm not ready to hand this off quite yet, in a few weeks I will be. If you're highly fluent in DOM-oriented JavaScript and are interested in joining the Hands Free project, contact <a href="mailto:development@handsfreechrom.com">development@handsfreechrome.</a></p>
