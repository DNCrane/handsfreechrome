			<p>Hands Free is written in JavaScript. You can find the source <a href="#">on Github</a>, but be warned that I'm not really a world-class JS developer, and the structure of the extension isn't first-rate. It comes in at less than 1000 lines, so it's not terrible, but because I was mostly concerned with just getting it out there, I didn't really write it with extensibility in mind.

			<p>For instance, the voice commands are all hardcoded in English, making internationalization a more difficult undertaking than it should have to be, and there is presently no support for "splats", commands which take an indeterminate number of arguments, like "Search for: jet planes painted with fire."</p>

			<p>I probably should have used <a href="http://www.talater.com">Annyang</a>, but by the time I found out about it I was too far in.</p>

			<p>At any rate, other projects are going to consume my time quite soon, and I would like to hand this project off to more capable developers who can take what I've started and run with it.</p>

			<p>Hands Free will make a sizable difference to those who cannot use their hands, so I believe it's a very worthy project. In truth, I think this functionality should be built in to the Chrome browser itself--- this shouldn't be an extension. That would make Chrome the most handicapped-friendly application in existence.</p>
