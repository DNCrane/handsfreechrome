			Features to be added in the future include:
			<ul>
				<li>An improved version of the map command that supports more pages.</li>
				<li>Phonetic mode for dictation mode, allowing you to use the International Phonetic Alphabet (alpha bravo charlie...) to spell things out. That way, you can literally write anything, even complex usernames and passwords. Don't worry, there will be a popup guide to the IPA until you remember it on your own. It's actually not too hard.</li>
				<li>"Find" feature to search pages for text</li>
				<li>Controls for videos, allowing you to play/pause and possibly adjust volume and time sliders. Given that playing a video would mean creating sound, you would need to wear a headset with a mic in order to still be able to give commands while the video is playing. Otherwise the video would create too much background noise.</li>
				<li>A "tab map" command to number all the tabs, so you can pick one instantly instead of having to say "switch" repeatedly.</li>
				<li>A visual indication of whether you're in dictation mode or control mode.</li>
				<li>A way to view your bookmarks and browsing history, and to select pages from them.</li>
				<li>Multiple window support. There would be a new command added to let you change which window you're controlling.</li>
				<li>Once there's support for multiple windows, we can add a "split screen" command to automatically create two windows and position them so they each take up half the screen.</li>
				<li>Select/Copy/Paste support.</li>
				<li>A way to select options from dropdown menus.</li>
