				You're not using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>! Once you're in Chrome, come back to download Hands Free here, or get it from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hands-free-for-chrome/ddgmnkioeodkdacpjblmihodjgmebnld">the Chrome Web Store.</a>
			</p>
			<p class="flash quick_start">
				<strong>Quick Start Guide</strong><br>
				After installing Hands Free, restart Chrome, then open any webpage and hit Ctrl + Space. Give the input window permission to use your mic. <br> Then just say <strong>help</strong>.
			</p>
			<p class="flash mac_warning">
				<span><strong>Are you using a Mac?</strong></span><br>
				In order to effectively use Hands Free on a Mac, first go to System Preferences, then to Sound, then to Input. If there's a little checkbox option that says "Use ambient noise reduction," make sure that it is <i>not</i> checked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hands Free can scroll around, click things, navigate to particular webpages, go back or forward in your browsing history, enter text into forms, check and uncheck checkboxes, zoom in and out, open and close tabs, refresh the page, and more. This is an initial release, and many improvements and additional features will soon follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the average user, Hands Free permits easy browsing while eating or multitasking, finally bringing an end to the dark era in which a comfortable individual would have to physically move in order to click, scroll, or type.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the handicapped user, Hands Free will immensely facilitate access to information and communication via the world wide web.
			</p>
			<p>
				This extension is for the Chrome web browser, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">the Google Chrome website</a>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				This extension will always be free, but we <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/24704">happily accept donations</a> if you would like to express your support or encourage further development.</p>

			<p>
				This extension is (soon to be) open source. If you would like to contribute to its development, take a look at the development page.
