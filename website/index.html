				Hands Free can scroll around, click things, navigate to particular webpages, go back or forward in your browsing history, enter text into forms, check and uncheck checkboxes, zoom in and out, open and close tabs, refresh the page, and more. This is an initial release, and many improvements and additional features will soon follow.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the average user, Hands Free permits easy browsing while eating or multitasking, finally bringing an end to the dark era in which a comfortable individual would have to physically move in order to click, scroll, or type.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the handicapped user, Hands Free will immensely facilitate access to information and communication via the world wide web.
				</p>
				<p>
				This extension is for the Chrome web browser, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">the Google Chrome website</a>.
