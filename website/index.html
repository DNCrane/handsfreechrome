				Hands Free can scroll around, click things, navigate to particular webpages, go back or forward in your browsing history, enter text into forms, check and uncheck checkboxes, search pages for text, zoom in and out, open and close tabs, refresh the page, and more. This is an initial release, and many improvements and additional features will soon follow.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the average user, Hands Free permits easy browsing while eating or multitasking, and finally brings an end to the dark era in which a comfortable person would need to physically move in order to click, scroll, or type.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the handicapped user, Hands Free will prove transformative, immensely facilitating access to information and communication via the world wide web.
				</p>
				<p>
				This extension is for the Chrome web browser, which can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">the Google Chrome website</a>.
