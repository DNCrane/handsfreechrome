			Hands Free for Chrome allows the user to do nearly everything they could normally, without ever touching a mouse or keyboard.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can scroll around, click things, navigate to particular webpages, go back or forward in your browsing history, enter text into forms, check and uncheck checkboxes, search pages for text, zoom in and out, open and close tabs, refresh the page, and more. This is an initial release, and many improvements and additional features will soon follow.
			</p>
			<p>
			For the ordinary user, Hands Free permits you to browse easily while eating, or to just be lazy if you find you're rather comfortable and donâ€™t feel so much like moving.
			</p>
			<p>
			For the handicapped user, Hands Free will prove transformative with regards to accessing and using digital information and communication via the world wide web.
