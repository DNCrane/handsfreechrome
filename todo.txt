-scroll up
-scroll down
-back
-forward
-map (links first, then forms...then numbers and special characters)
	-cancel map.
-map2 - creates tags on all elements with text inside them.
	for use on sophisticated pages like gmail.
-auto-turn-on voice control (when extension is active) for yes/no boxes
-zoom in
-zoom out
-zoom / enhance (this would be HILARIOUS...fuzz things and wait for second command)
-bookmarks map
-close tab
-exit
-url
-new tab
-switch (reposition tags to allow readability)
