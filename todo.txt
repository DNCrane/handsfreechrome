v1.0 major goals:

-next bug
-settings
-command to move window from foreground to background and vice versa. is this possible? yes.
-indication of whether we're in dictation or control mode

------------

v2.0 major goals:

-improve map
-add phonetic mode
-video controls
-find
-textarea bug

-----------

v3.0 major goals:

-tab map
-bookmarks

------------

-auto-turn-on voice control (when extension is active) for yes/no message boxes
-bookmarks map
-reposition tags to allow readability

Let other people tackle making this multi-lingual.

This should all be adjustable in a settings box, really.

-let people toggle whether a page that starts with the cursor in a form element
 defaults to dictation mode or control mode

-make home command actually go to particular homepage

-if chrome says "did you mean this" automatically go back and display a message
-Actually I can't do that-- but what I can do is set up a ping system so that it opens the goto
page in a new tab, then attempts to contact it, and if it works, copies its location to the current tab
and closes the new tab.

"scroll reading" command for auto-slow speed

split screen, create new tab if only one is open
minimize, maximize
for picking a tab-- prepend a number in every tab title, then pick by number, just like with map
last tab - like back in history, for tabs...same at ctrl+tab
downloads
history
bookmarks
find/search

"next" could have unexpected results if it goes to an offscreen form.
only allow it to work for currently visible forms, require a scroll down to continue

It often mishears single-digit numbers (e.g. "three" sounds like "free"). 2-digit numbers are much more reliable ("two three" will usually be heard correctly). 3-digit numbers are even better, but a bit less convenient to say. We should start counting either at 20 or at 100.
--
The "show" command can be a bit slow to respond if there are a lot of links -- can we speed this up?
-- 
The "show" command seems to not work for links that are below the fold?
--
If "Keep showing" is on and you say "show", you can't get the numbers back unless you say "stop showing" first.
--
Any time you add a new alias in the options page, you have to refresh the input page for it to take effect. It'd be nice if you didn't have to.
--
All of the numbers that show up for link selection can be a bit annoying and cover too much. Maybe make them transparent?
--
The command delay/lastMessage/lastTime stuff in control.js doesn't quite seem to work correctly. E.g. if I say "shoulder" a little slowly, it will do the "show" command.
