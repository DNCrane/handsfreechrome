v1.0 major goals:

-next bug
-page start text
-numbers bug
-settings
-bottom doesn't work with help
-number delay barely working if at all
-reload page on start so that it works without user reloading

------------

v2.0 major goals:

-improve map
-add phonetic mode
-video controls
-find

-----------

v3.0 major goals:

-tab map
-home command
-move "go to" to background.js so "oops did you mean" isn't a problem ... this'll be a big task
-bookmarks

------------

-auto-turn-on voice control (when extension is active) for yes/no message boxes
-bookmarks map
-reposition tags to allow readability

Let other people tackle making this multi-lingual.

This should all be adjustable in a settings box, really.

-let people toggle whether a page that starts with the cursor in a form element
 defaults to dictation mode or control mode

-make home command actually go to particular homepage

-if chrome says "did you mean this" automatically go back and display a message
-Actually I can't do that-- but what I can do is set up a ping system so that it opens the goto
page in a new tab, then attempts to contact it, and if it works, copies its location to the current tab
and closes the new tab.

"scroll reading" command for auto-slow speed

Can we clear the interim buffer the MOMENT we get it, to get rid of that delay from bad input like talking?
split screen, create new tab if only one is open
minimize, maximize
for picking a tab-- prepend a number in every tab title, then pick by number, just like with map
last tab - like back in history, for tabs...same at ctrl+tab

"next" could have unexpected results if it goes to an offscreen form.
only allow it to work for currently visible forms, require a scroll down to continue
