			<h1>Installation and Usage Guide</h1>
			<p>When you add Hands Free to your Chrome browser, it will ask you to give the extension various permissions, which will allow the extension to do things like create and close tabs when commanded.</p>

			<p>Having given Hands Free the necessary permissions, you can then hit Ctrl + Space on any webpage to pop up the Hands Free
			input window. This is the window that listens to you and hears your commands. The first time it opens, it will ask you for
			permission to access your mic. It goes without saying that without access to the mic, Hands Free cannot function. 
			You won't need to grant this permission again the next time you use the extension. The input window can also be opened by clicking on the newly added Hands Free icon in the upper right corner of your browser.</p>

			<p>After that, you can minimize the input window or leave it in front-- it makes no difference. You may find it useful to leave it visible so that you can see whether it heard you correctly.</p>

			<p>The words that appear above the line in the input window when you speak are words that Hands Free is still processing-- once they move to beneath the line, Hands Free is finished taking that input and is ready for a new command.</p>

			<p>You can hit Ctrl + Space again at any time to close the input window (thus turning off Hands Free), or just say <kbd>done</kbd>.</p>

			<p>Hands Free does not support multiple windows-- you must use multiple tabs within a single window. The input window does not count and may be considered an exception. Also, don't open any additional tabs in the input window.</p>

			<p>Hands Free will prove extremely difficult to use in areas with any backgroud noise, such as music or people talking. Background noise makes it very difficult for the voice recognition to understand your commands.</p>

			<p>At present, the two most major problems with Hands Free are that the voice recognition will often mishear you and that the <kbd>map</kbd> command (which is used to click things) is extremely buggy. The <kbd>map</kbd> command will soon be improved, and voice recognition technology gets better with each passing year.</p>

			<p>Hands Free is only available in English at the present time, but in the future many languages will be supported.</p>

			<p>Hands Free turns itself off automatically after 3 minutes pass without receiving a new command. You can refresh the input window to turn it back on, or close the input window and open it again.</p>

			<h1>Command Guide</h1>

		    <p>Say <kbd>help</kbd> to bring up a copy of this command guide.</p>

		    <p>The most common problem is a command being misheard by the
		    speech engine. By observing the Hands Free input window, you can see
		    what it thinks you said. This may help you learn the proper
		    enunciations necessary in order to be understood more readily. </p>

		    <h3>Scrolling</h3>

		    <p>To scroll up a small amount, say <kbd>up</kbd>.<br>
		    To scroll down a small amount, say <kbd>down</kbd>.<br>
		    To scroll a small amount to the right, say <kbd>right</kbd>.<br>
		    To scroll a small amount to the left, say <kbd>left</kbd>.</p>

		    <p>To page up, say <kbd>rise</kbd>.<br>
		    To page down, say <kbd>fall</kbd>.</p>

		    <p>To scroll to the bottom of the page, say <kbd>bottom</kbd>.<br>
		    To scroll to the top of the page, say <kbd>top</kbd>.</p>

		    <p>To set the page scrolling continuously up, say <kbd>keep scrolling
		    up</kbd>.<br>
		    To set the page scrolling continuously down, say <kbd>keep scrolling
		    down</kbd>.<br>
		    To stop the page from continously scrolling, say <kbd>stop</kbd>.<br>
		    To control the speed of scrolling, say <kbd>faster</kbd> or
		    <kbd>slower</kbd>. The changes will be small, but you can issue these
		    commands repeatedly for incremental gains.</p>

		    <h3>Clicking</h3>

		    <p>To paint number tags alongside what are most likely visible,
		    clickable elements on the page, say <kbd>map</kbd>. The tags will
		    appear near the upper left corner of the corresponding link, image, or
		    input form. Use your best judgement to tell which is which.<br>
		    Saying <kbd>map</kbd> a second time will hide the number tags, as will
		    using any of the scrolling commands.</p>

		    <p>If the element you wish to click is not numbered by <kbd>map</kbd>,
		    try hiding the numbers and using <kbd>guide</kbd> instead. (The "guide"
		    command is usually misheard, and will be changed.)</p>

		    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: The system by which clickable
		    elements are numbered will be heavily improved in the future, but for
		    the time being there will be many frustrations in the placement of the
		    numbers.</p>

		    <p>To click a numbered element, simply speak the number. Enunciate very
		    clearly— the speech engine will readily confuse numbers like 15 and 50,
		    or 16 and 60.</p>

		    <h3>Dictation Mode</h3>

		    <p>If you’ve clicked a text input, Hands Free will switch into
		    dictation mode, and anything you say will be written as text into the
		    selected text input.</p>

		    <p>To turn off dictation mode and return to the normal control
		    functionality, say <kbd>stop</kbd>.<br>
		    To submit the textbox you’re typing in (the equivalent of pressing
		    ‘enter’), say <kbd>go</kbd>. This is what you want when you finish
		    typing in a searchbox, for example.<br>
		    To move the cursor to the next input in the form (for example, from
		    username to password), say <kbd>next</kbd>.<br>
		    <br>
		    <i>Note: Buttons in forms count as inputs, so you may inadvertently
		    move to a button first. Simply continue to say next until the input you
		    desire is selected.</i><br>
		    <br>
		    To remove the last word you entered from the textbox, say
		    <kbd>undo</kbd>.</p>

		    <h3>Navigation</h3>

		    <p>To go to ANY website, say the name of the website on its own with
		    the domain specified. There is no need to say “www.”<br>
		    Examples: <kbd>google.com</kbd>, <kbd>en.wikipedia.org</kbd>
		    (pronounced E-N-dot-wikipedia-dot-org), <kbd>mit.edu</kbd> (pronounced
		    M-I-T-dot-E-D-U), <kbd>fr.wikipedia.org</kbd> (pronounced
		    F-R-dot-wikipedia-dot-org)</p>

		    <p>To go to a particular .com website, say <kbd>go to [website
		    name]</kbd>. You can include the .com or omit it.<br>
		    Examples: <kbd>go to google</kbd>, <kbd>go to google.com</kbd>, <kbd>go
		    to amazon</kbd>, <kbd>go to facebook</kbd></p>

		    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: there are some websites with longer
		    names which will register erroneously with the engine. For example,
		    there is no way to reach freecreditreport.com, which will be heard as
		    “free credit report.com”, and will consequently send you to
		    report.com.</p>

		    <p>To go back one page in your history, say <kbd>back</kbd>.<br>
		    To go forward one page in your history, say <kbd>forward</kbd>.</p>

		    <p>To go to google.com, say <kbd>home</kbd>.</p>

		    <p>Note that Google can be used to indirectly reach almost any website that you can't
		    navigate to directly via Hands Free. For instance, going to Google and searching for
		    "free credit report.com" will correctly bring up as a result the actual "freecreditreport.com",
		    which you can then click on.</p>

		    <h3>Controlling Tabs</h3>

		    <p>To open a new tab, say <kbd>new tab</kbd>.</p>

		    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: When opening a new tab, this
		    extension will stop working unless you have installed the new tab
		    redirect extension, which will direct new tabs to default to a page of
		    your choosing. That extension can be found at
		    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en</p>

		    <p>To close the current tab, say <kbd>close tab</kbd>.<br>
		    To switch the active tab to the next tab in the window, say
		    <kbd>switch</kbd>.</p>

		    <h3>Controlling the Window</h3>

		    <p>To enter or exit full screen mode, say <kbd>full screen</kbd>. All
		    commands work just the same in full screen mode.<br>
		    To minimize, say <kbd>minimize</kbd>.</p>

		    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: Unfortunately the ‘maximize’
		    command is broken in Chrome. You may be able to restore your window
		    from a minimized state by using the full screen command and then
		    toggling it off, but this has lately proved unreliable. Using the
		    minimize command is currently not recommended.</p>

		    <p>To close all Chrome windows entirely, say <kbd>exit</kbd> or
		    <kbd>quit</kbd>.</p>

		    <h3>Zooming</h3>

		    <p>To zoom in, say <kbd>zoom in</kbd>, or just <kbd>zoom</kbd>.<br>
		    To zoom out, say <kbd>zoom out</kbd>.<br>
		    To restore the zoom level to normal, say <kbd>zoom normal</kbd>.<br>
		    <br>
		    <i>Note: The zoom normal command oftentimes fails once or twice. Try
		    repeating it after a moment.</i></p>

		    <h3>Refreshing</h3>

		    <p>To reload the page, say <kbd>reload</kbd> or <kbd>refresh</kbd>.</p>

		    <h3>Closing Hands Free</h3>

		    <p>Lastly, to turn off Hands Free, say <kbd>done</kbd>.</p>
